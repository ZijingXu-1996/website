            <h2>Understanding Project Risks</h2>
            <p>Risk management is an important guarantee to ensure the smooth progress of the project, which is especially important for small organizations or charitable organizations with limited resources and weak risk resistance. Effective risk management requires organizations to have the ability to proactively identify potential threats, assess the likelihood and severity of their impact, and develop appropriate mitigation measures.</p>

            <h2>Practical Risk Management Strategies</h2>
            <p>Risk management is a key step to ensure that projects go smoothly, especially for small organizations with limited resources. Effective risk management requires identifying potential threats in advance, assessing their likelihood and impact, and developing appropriate response strategies.</p>
            <p>This guide recommends that companies establish a risk register and update it regularly, focusing on major risks that may affect budget, schedule or quality; establishing financial buffers and diversifying suppliers are practical ways to reduce operational risks. The Irish Federation of Small Businesses provides a set of simplified risk assessment tools, especially for organizations that lack dedicated risk managers. By integrating risk management into daily operations, companies can prepare before problems arise, rather than reacting to crises.</p>
            
            <p>By incorporating risk management practices into daily operations, small organizations or charities can proactively address potential challenges and increase the probability of project success. The outcome dimension of the ECCSR framework reminds us that risk management should ultimately serve the core objectives of the project and the needs of stakeholders.</p>

                <p>A fashion boutique identified "supplier dependency" as a high-probability, high-impact risk during their planning phase. By:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developing relationships with 3 alternative suppliers</li>
                    <li>Maintaining 15% additional inventory buffer</li>
                    <li>Creating a supplier evaluation scorecard</li>

                <p>They reduced supply chain disruption risk by 65% in their first year of operation.</p>
